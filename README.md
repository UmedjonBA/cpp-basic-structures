# C++ Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of basic data structures and algorithms in C++ along with corresponding test cases.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following:

- **Big Integer**: Arbitrary precision integer operations
- **Deque**: Double-ended queue implementation
- **Factorization**: Prime factorization algorithms
- **Geometry**: Basic geometric algorithms and structures
- **Matrix**: Matrix operations and algorithms
- **Pointwise Sum**: Vector summation operations
- **Python-like Range**: Range implementation similar to Python's
- **Ring Buffer**: Circular buffer implementation
- **Smart Pointers**: Custom smart pointer implementations
- **String**: Custom string class with common operations
- **Signal Processing**: Basic signal processing utilities
- **Triangle Classification**: Triangle type determination

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler with C++17 support (g++ or clang++)
- Make utility
- Bash shell (for test scripts)

### Running Tests

Each implementation comes with its own test suite. To run tests for a specific module:

```bash
./test.sh <module-name>
```

For example, to test the string implementation:

```bash
./test.sh cpp-23-24-string
```

1. `cpp-23-24-big-integer`
2. `cpp-23-24-deque`
3. `cpp-23-24-factorization`
